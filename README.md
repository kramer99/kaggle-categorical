# kaggle-categorical
Recipes for pre-processing categorical features in data. I leaned on Pandas more heavily in this exercise than in the Titanic, all pre-processing of categorical fields was done within Pandas, and seems a little more straight-forward than doing the same in scikit-learn.

I also calculated precision, recall, and F1 scores for each variation of hyper-parameters, rather than just the accuracy score I'd used for Titanic.
